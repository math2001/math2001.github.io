&lt;p&gt;My sister had to do some artwork for school, and she decided to make some
curved shapes out of lines. It looks pretty cool (although it would have been
even better with pencil I think, but she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t listen, and I&amp;rsquo;m too lazy to
do it myself right now), and making curves out of &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; lines, well, I find
that pretty fancy. But I wondered what the curves actually were&amp;hellip; Circles?
Parabolas? Ellipses? Something different?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you studied physics, one of the first things you probably did was graph the
&amp;ldquo;motion&amp;rdquo; of objects. That is the displacement, velocity, and acceleration at
an instant &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;. Didn&amp;rsquo;t it remind you of a mathematical concept?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Length of a curve</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After misunderstanding a question in physics, I thought I had to calculate the
length of a curved trajectory (ie. the distance) instead of just the straight
line (ie. the displacement). Turns out it was the easy option, but I now wanted
to know how to get the length of a curve. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;d just be summing up
an infinite number of straight lines, which is almost exactly what integration
is&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
