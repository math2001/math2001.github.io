      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://math2001.github.io/img/curve-lines-drawing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;drawing with lines only that form curves&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister had to do some artwork for school, and she decided to make some
curved shapes out of lines. It looks pretty cool (although it would have been
even better with pencil I think, but she wouldn&#39;t listen, and I&#39;m too lazy to
do it myself right now), and making curves out of &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; lines, well, I find
that pretty fancy. But I wondered what the curves actually were&amp;hellip; Circles?
Parabolas? Ellipses? Something different?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
