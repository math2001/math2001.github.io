A very strong point of vim is its documentation. There's just so much of it!!
So, **use it** <!--more-->

It doesn't matter if you're an experienced user of vim or a complete beginner,
there'll be something in there for you to learn *for sure*.

Where could you start? Well, at the index of course! Just type `:help` and hit
<kbd>enter</kbd> and scroll down a bit.

See that? You got a few kind of "tutorials" (I especially like the one `Clever
tricks`). Looks like you got a lot of learning to go :smile:!
