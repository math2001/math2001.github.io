![demo of ctrl-x_ctrl+l in insert mode in vim](/img/vim-ctrl-x_ctrl-l.gif)

Do you know what kind of completion this is? **Line** completion. It looks for
every lines that starts with the same text (it doesn't take into consideration
the indication), and completes it for you! Awesome right?

And to do that, you just need to press this while you're in insert mode:

<kbd>ctrl+x</kbd> and <kbd>ctrl+l</kbd>
