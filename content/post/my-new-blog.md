Hello everyone!

My name's Mathieu Paturel - `@math2001` - and I love coding.

I'm French (from Provence, if you know where that is), but my family and I moved 2 years ago to
Australia so that we could learn to speak fluently English (without this disgusting accent :smile:).

### How did I discovered coding

It all started with the basic "programming language" (notice the quotes :smile:). My farther taught
me the very basic of programming (and it was pretty much all you could do with this language I'd
:laughing:). The farthest I went with this is making a little program that would ask test you on the
tables of multiplications.

It was interesting, but honestly, it wasn't too fun. The fun started when my uncle showed my Python
(:heart:). We made a game with `pygame`. I said <q>We</q>, but it was more "he". He was typing, I
was following along, thinking I was understanding most of it.

But when he said:

> All right, your turn now!

I realized I didn't remember much, I had no idea what to do (to make a simple program that would
draw lines around the corners of the screens)...

Then, we moved to Australia. My farther had to look for a job, and it pretty hard. It took him 8
month. During this time, we couldn't go to the Australian school, since because we were just
visitors, the cost was pretty high (something like $500 per week and per children, which is $1500
per week). We were living on our savings, so we stayed at home, only doing remote French school
(called CNED, really bad...). It was only partial, since we were meant to go the Australian school
too. So, it would took us around half a day every day. The rest was free time.

So, since I didn't what to do, I started looking at Python again, making some little games.

Of course, I had some issues, some thing I didn't know how to do. So, what did I do? Looked it up on
the internet. The problem was that it was pretty hard, since we had to go to the library to get a
miserably slow connection.

All I was aware of was the `help` function of python. That's it. I had no idea about the Python
documentation, or any other resources. All I could do was look at the programs my uncle left me, and
kind of "guess". Lucky I was using Python and not JavaScript or PHP :smile:.

And one website's forum kept coming up: [openclassrooms.com](https://openclassrooms.com). It's a
French one (although their now making some courses in English). I discovered that they had a course
about `pygame` and python. I read them, and kept making some little games.

One day, my uncle send me an email saying that I should look at `flask` to make some little
websites. Luckily, they had a course about this on OpenClassrooms. But one of the requirement was
to know `html`, which I didn't. Of course, they had a course about it. I read it, started loving web
dev, forgot Flask and followed the author with the course he recommended next: PHP and MySql.

While still making some little games with Python, some little websites with PHP, I learned git
(with a course on OpenClassrooms of course). This was a pretty big step. It didn't appear like it
*straight away*, but when I look back, I'm pretty sure it is, and for one reason:

[GitHub][]

It took me a while to figure out the basics, though.

I started making some plugins for Sublime Text. I was much more comfortable with python. My first
plugin was a kind of a failure, I haven't deleted [the repo][snippetlister] just for fun. 

The plugin was working, but when I send the PR to get on package control, I didn't understand the
maintainer's response (I really didn't speak properly English at the time). I thought he rejected
the PR I read the answer from the email notification, I didn't understood that I could edit the
code and edit it, I didn't really get concept of Pull Request (I just followed the step by step
guide in the Package Control's documentation). I never answered anything back (I don't even remember
seeing the ping from the maintainer). The result being that the PR was closed. :disappointed:

But anyway... I made some other plugins later on, I had a better understanding of GitHub, and some
of [my plugins][] are now on Package Control.

You might be wondering why this is relevant. Well, my Sublime Text plugins were the first repository
I shared with other people.

It's from here that I started to have a decent workflow, read the documentations, learn some new
cool stuff.

So, now, here I am. I created this new blog to share what I know.

Hopefully you'll enjoy the content!
