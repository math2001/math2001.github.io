![demo of ctrl-x_ctrl+l in insert mode in vim](/img/vim-ctrl-x_ctrl-l.gif)

Do you know what kind of completion this is? **Line** completion. It looks for
every lines that starts with the same text (it doesn't take into consideration
the indication), and completes it for you! Awesome right? <!--more-->

And to do that, you just need to press this while you're in insert mode:

<kbd>ctrl+x</kbd> and <kbd>ctrl+l</kbd>
