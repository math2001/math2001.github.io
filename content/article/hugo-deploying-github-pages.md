When you want to deploy a static website built with the fantastic [Hugo][] on
GitHub pages, you don't have 100 of possibilities. A clean one, and an easy one
:smile:.<!--more-->

The easy one is to build your website to the `docs` folder. It's not super clean
though since the source code is on the same branch as the built code. It doesn't
make diffing super great, gives a long output when you commit, you have to build
at every single commit to keep consistent.

You got it, I don't like it.

So, the other solution is to build it on the `gh-pages` branch. I could do it
manually every time, but wasting my time isn't my thing... :smile: No, I wanted
to build something like [mkdocs][] has:

    mkdocs gh-deploy

And boom, it builds your website to an other branch (in this case `gh-pages`),
commit, and push.

So, I tripped a few times along the way of making this little script (life tip:
if you `rm` files automatically, make sure at least 3 times that no files in a
`.git` folder gets delete :wink:, you'd loose **everything**)

### Installation

Just download [this
script](https://GitHub.com/math2001/math2001.GitHub.io/blob/dev/deploy.sh).

### Usage

In your hugo config, add a `publishBranch` key with the name of the branch you
want. It should be a string.

Then, you just need run the script you just downloaded, and it'll build, commit,
and push for you!

This script does some weird stuff due to git submodules not coping very well with
branches in the parent repository. When you `checkout`, the submodules don't get
removed/added, you need to do it manually. If you have submodules in your
website's sources elsewhere than in your theme folders (`themes` by default),
you'll need to tweak this script a bit.
