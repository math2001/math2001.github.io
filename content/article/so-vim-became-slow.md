You know that feeling? You press in a key, and you have to wait like 0.5 seconds
to see it appear on screen. You try to run `vim --clean` and everything's back
to "normal". How do you find _quickly_ the cause of this horrible disaster :smile: <!--more-->

As you expected, it is caused by a/some plugin(s) and/or you vimrc. Have fun
debugging that. You probably know the bulk force: disable every plugin, and
enable them once at a time to know which one's slow.

If you want my opinion: that's a huge waste of time.

Vim comes with a... **profiler**! That means, you can profiles VimScript code
(which is what plugins and what your vimrc is made out of). So, you can just
profile everything, and see what take a long time to run. Here's how:

You open vim, type in:

```vimscript
:profile start profile.log
:profile func *
:profile file *
```

You do the slow things (it can be just typing, running a function, etc), and
then:

```vimscript
:profile pause
```

And quit (`:qa`)

Now open up `profile.log` (it might be fairly long), and go to the bottom.

It'll look something like this:

```

```

And now, you should see something that sorts functions based on how long they
took. You can now determine from which plugin/script that was (if you're not
sure, a big fat `grep functionname -R` in your `.vim` directory should tell
you), and you'll know which plugins slowing you down!

Have fun!

#### Details

If you want, you can of course go into a bit more details and see which
statements were slow in each function by scrolling back up in the `profile.log`
file ;)

#### Nice little commands

Put that in your `.vimrc` ;)

```vimscript
command! ProfileMe :profile start profile.log <bar> profile func * <bar> profile file *
command! ProfileStop :profile pause
```
