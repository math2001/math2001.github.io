On windows, the cmd sucks. But if you have sh installed from git-for-windows
for example, you can tell vim to run external commands `:!` using this `sh`!.<!--more-->

Add this to your `.vimrc`

```vim
set shell=sh
set shellcmdflag=-c
```

Now, vim won't run external commands like this

    cmd /c "your command"

But like this:

    sh -c "your command"

So, you can now run Unix commands from VIM.
