Today I learned something a bit weird in mathematics, which I find quiet funny
and interesting.<!--more-->

> Write 0.9 repeater (0.999...) in the form of a fraction

This can be done using an equation, have a look:

$$
\begin{aligned}
n &= 0.999...
10n &= 9.999...
10n - n &= 9
9n &= 9
n &= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

So, 0.9 repeater is equal to 1. When I saw this, I thought I made a mistake
somewhere, but I didn't, and here's how I "explain" it (to myself at least).

As the nines keep going, the number gets closer to 1, right? Well,
because they go on infinitely, they "eventually" reach 1.

Funny, right? Feels like saying 1 = 2...
