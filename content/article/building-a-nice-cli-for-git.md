I'll admit, git is awesome. I've never seen any bugs with it, it's reliable,
and everyone uses it. It's just so sweet.

But damn is the CLI shit. I'm sorry for using bad language, but come on! What
is that thing?? I won't even bother giving examples.

So, I'm tinkering with the idea of building a user friendly wrapper around git.
But that's like probably the best way to introduce bug in a reliable system,
and who wants to use a scary wrapper?

Or going all out and building my own version control. Just to see what would
happen, to learn how git works internally.

The problem with making my own version control is that then it probably won't
work with GitHub, which I just can't have. Otherwise I'd need to build an
equivalent as well. Plus (here I actually don't know what I'm talking about),
but the git internal must be robust, therefore it might be a good idea to
create an alternative _CLI_ which would use the same underlying files (like
`.git` folder)

Just an idea, because it sure does sound like a _lot of fun_ to me. But I
probably won't need it badly enough to find the time...
