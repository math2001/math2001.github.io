Ever wanted to write fancy symbols in your code or your documentation, like the
copyright symbol for example (©). Do you know how much time it took me to insert
this symbol? Less than a second... Do you know how much time it would have took
you? Well, depending on your internet connection, it might be about 10 seconds.<!--more-->

So, how did I do that? I just pressed <kbd>ctr+k</kbd>+<kbd>Co</kbd> (in insert
mode).

<kbd>ctrl+k</kbd> _in insert mode_ listens for a shortcut, which will then insert
the corresponding symbol.

How do you know which one it is? Just look for it in the `:digraphs` list!

You can also define your own digraph:

```vim
:digraph .. …
```

You can also specify the decimal value of the symbol, like so:

```vim
:diagraph .. 8230
```

You might be wondering how you get the value... Well, have a look at this: <tiplink to="vim-ascii.md"></tiplink>

## Little cheat sheet

Because I'm nice (:smile:), I made a little list of the ones you might be likely
to use:

    Abbreviation → Symbol
    Co → ©
    TM → ™
    -> → →
    <- → ←
    => → ⇒
    <= → ⇐
    12 → ½
    22 → ²
    << → «
    >> → »
    Eu → €
    $$ → £
    RT → √
    -- → ­

### If you're french

    Abbreviation → Symbol
    e! → è
    e' → é
    e> → ê
    e" → ë
    oe → œ

Note: use upper cased abbreviation to get upper cased symbols
