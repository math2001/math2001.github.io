[Python](https://python.org) is by far my favorite language (I even wish we
[spoke it :smile:). One thing I found funny about it, and in the same time
really good, is [its zen](https://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/); they're
basically guidelines.

So, today, _dans un Ã©lan d'inspiration_, I decided to write my own.<!--more-->

```
Keep it simple.
Lazyness is a quality.
Learn to use your tools efficiently.
Get inspired by great things.
Do one thing, and do it well.
Perfect programmers don't need comments.
But every user needs documentation.
```
