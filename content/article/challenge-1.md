I've got a little challenge for you.<!--more-->

    ib jb eikybfi eite hvim

Can you translate this encrypted text back to its original form?

If you do, send me an email at
[math2001.contact@protonmail.com](mailto:math2001.contact@protonmail.com)
explaining how you found it, and I'll add you to the glorious list of people who
found the solution to my challenge (see below).

### Rules

I guarantee you the original message:

- contains only lower case ASCII letters (`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`)
- has the same spaces as in the encrypted message. So you know that the first
  word will have 2 letters, the second one as well, the third one 7, etc...
- can only translated to one string (the one I gave you)

### They found it!

> The glorious and amazing people who had a crack and found the secret message!

_No one yet. :cry:_

### Solution

Hey hey. Smart one, looking at the right place, :smile:

I'll be posting the original message, as well as an explanation about how it
worked next week, that is the **Friday 1 June 2018**.
