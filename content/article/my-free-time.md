Although I'm on vacations right now (16 Jan 2020), it doesn't feel like I have a lot of free time on my hands. Better snippet manager is not the most interesting (in terms of development) nor useful plugin I think.

It's going to get worse as I'll start university soon, and so I would rather focus fewer projects (like FileManager, reading books, my toread list just grows faster than I can control, playing music, etc).

I'll merge clean PRs, but i don't want to "spread" my energy just working on problems I already know how to approach, and that don't really affect me that much (like I'll happily work on a problem I don't know how to solve :smiley:). It sounds pretty rude when I read this sentence again, but that's the truth, I need to make sure I don't drain myself to at least keep a few things I care about running.

That doesn't mean I'll never fix it, but I'll probably just have one random day when I'll feel like fixing. But there's no guarantee when that will be.

I'll live this issue open
