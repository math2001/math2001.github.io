&lt;p&gt;My sister had to do some artwork for school, and she decided to make some
curved shapes out of lines. It looks pretty cool (although it would have been
even better with pencil I think, but she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t listen, and I&amp;rsquo;m too lazy to
do it myself right now), and making curves out of &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; lines, well, I find
that pretty fancy. But I wondered what the curves actually were&amp;hellip; Circles?
Parabolas? Ellipses? Something different?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Go Order of Operation Matters</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Go, two mathematically equivalent expression can yield different result
based on the order in which you do things! Thanks rounding errors&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Motion and calculus</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you studied physics, one of the first things you probably did was graph the
&amp;ldquo;motion&amp;rdquo; of objects. That is the displacement, velocity, and acceleration at
an instant &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;. Didn&amp;rsquo;t it remind you of a mathematical concept?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Length of a curve</title>
      <link>https://math2001.github.io/article/length-of-a-curve/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After misunderstanding a question in physics, I thought I had to calculate the
length of a curved trajectory (ie. the distance) instead of just the straight
line (ie. the displacement). Turns out it was the easy option, but I now wanted
to know how to get the length of a curve. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;d just be summing up
an infinite number of straight lines, which is almost exactly what integration
is&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to combine svgs</title>
      <link>https://math2001.github.io/article/combine-svgs/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want your website to be fast, you should limit the number of http
requests. A great way of doing that is combining your images. If you use SVGS
for your icons and stuff like that, here&amp;rsquo;s how you can combine all your icon in
one big file, and use them in your website!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bash&#39;s find command</title>
      <link>https://math2001.github.io/article/bashs-find-command/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; command in bash is quite powerful, and knowing the basics might save
you some scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it do? It &amp;ldquo;finds&amp;rdquo; files. By default, it outputs their path relative to
where you ran &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt;. But, in addition of providing you with advanced &amp;ldquo;filters&amp;rdquo;
it actually allows you to run commands on each of those files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
